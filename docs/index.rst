COSIMA Cookbook
===============

Welcome to the COSIMA Cookbook! 

This repository is a Cookbook of Recipes 👩🏽‍🍳 👨🏻‍🍳.

We explain: a "recipe" here is an example an analysis of some ocean-sea ice model output or some ocean-related observational datasets.
Each "recipe" comes in a self-contained and well-documented Jupyter notebook.
All the recipes combined form a cookbook 📒!

Happy cooking! 😉 🥙 🍱 🍲

Using the Recipes
======

To get started have a look at the tutorials_ and then browse through the
available recipes_ to find something that better suits your 'taste' (i.e., your needs)!
